Terraform output values allow you to export structured data about your resources. 
You can use this data to configure other parts of your infrastructure with automation tools, or as a data source for another Terraform workspace. 
Outputs are also necessary to share data from a child module to your root module.

output "public_url" {
  description = "Public URL for our Web Server"
  value = "https://${aws_instance.web_server.public_ip}:8080/index.html"
}

output "vpc_information" {
  description = "VPC Information about Environment"
  value = "Your ${aws_vpc.vpc.tags.Environment} VPC has an ID of ${aws_vpc.vpc.id}"
}


If you ever need to read the values of your Terraform outputs but might be nervous about running a terraform apply, 
you can use the terraform output command to view them.

Run a terraform output -jsonand view the list of outputs in JSON format from your configuration

terraform output -json
